House Price Prediction Dataset

Overview
This project involves predicting house prices using a synthetic dataset of 500/1000 entries generated for various features, such as house size, location, number of bedrooms, and amenities. The dataset is designed to simulate real-world housing data and can be used for AI/ML model training and evaluation.

Synthetic Data Generation
The dataset was generated using Python's numpy and pandas libraries. Randomized values with realistic distributions were used to create the features and target variable (SalePrice). A noise factor was added to simulate real-world variations in house prices.

File Information
Dataset File: house_price_dataset_500.csv
Entries: 500 rows

Dependencies
To use or reproduce the dataset, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
numpy
pandas


How to Use

1.Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/house-price-prediction.git

2.Load the dataset in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:


import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('house_price_dataset_500.csv')
print(data.head())

3.Train AI/ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.) to predict house prices.
